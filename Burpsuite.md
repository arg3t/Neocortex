# Burp Suite

## Macros

Macros can be used to check whether your current session is valid, and they can be used alongside **Session Handling rules** in order to automatically recreate sessions.

## Intruder

-   You can use the **Grep - Extract** option in order to extract a certain part of every function.
-   When running time-based attacks like username enumeration or blind SQLi, you should set the thread number to **1** for best consistency. Also, you can enable the time column in intruder using Columns(On top of the window) > Response Received.
