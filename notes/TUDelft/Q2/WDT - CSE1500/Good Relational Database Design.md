## What makes a Relational Database Design Good?
* **Minimal Redundancy:** The less a database repeats the data in it, the better.
* **Prevents Modification Anomalies by Design:** This means anomalous modifications are prevented by using keys, not by enforcing an excessive amount of contraints. 
* **Matching the used RDBMS:** This provides faster query processing, but for this, redundancy can be necessary.
