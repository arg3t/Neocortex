## Primary Key
Primary keys are basically a certain [[Super Key]] which was chosen by the designer to identify a relation in a [[Relational Model]]. They often have semantic meaning(the make sense from the perspective of the database's user). All the other super keys which weren't chosen as the primary key are called *alternate keys*.
