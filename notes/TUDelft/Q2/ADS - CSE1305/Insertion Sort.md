## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a sort algorithm. It works by keeping the left side of the array sorted on each iteration and moves the element next to the sorted part of the array into the correct position. It has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$ since no auxiliary array was created in the process. Here is a small demonstration of how the algorith works:
