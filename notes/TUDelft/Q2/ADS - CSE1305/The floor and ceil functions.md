## The floor and ceil functions
There are two important functions that will come in handy throughout this course, *ceil* $\lceil x \rceil$ and *floor* $\lfloor x \rfloor$. Ceil basically rolls the number x into the closest greater integer, and floor the other way around, so $\lceil 16.2 \rceil = 17$ and $\lfloor 16.2 \rfloor = 16$.
