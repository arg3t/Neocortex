## Big-Oh Notation

### The easy way
Basically, if you have a function that consists of different versions of the **7 important functions** the one with the highest order/the one that changes with the highest values have the highest precedence. So, for example, the function $f(n) = 2n + n^2 + 3nlog_2(n) + 2^n + 6$ has the Big-Oh $O(2^n)$ since exponential functions have the highest order.
