## Indeterminate Forms and Dealing with Them
An indeterminate form in calculus is an equation which doesn't have a value. Such as $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ or $0 \times \infty$. There are three techniques you need to know to solve such indeterminate forms.:
* [[Cancelling Common Factors - Limit]]
* [[Square Root Trick - Limit]]
* [[The Squeeze Theorem - Limits]]
