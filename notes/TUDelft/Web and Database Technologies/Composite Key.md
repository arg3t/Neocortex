## Composite Key
It is possible that in a database schema, there are no [[Candidate Key]]s, which means that there is no attribute that is enough to act as a unique identifier for the tuples in the database. In those cases, it is possible that the combintion of more than one attribute can act as a key. The subset of attributes of a composite key cannot act as a key but when they come together, they can.
