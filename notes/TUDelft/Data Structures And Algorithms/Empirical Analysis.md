## Empirical Analysis
Empirical analysis is the process of running an algorithm with different input sizes and plotting/analyzin the change in input times overtime.

### Drawbacks of empirical analysis
- Runtime differs between different hardware, not just between different hardware but between different runs.
- Does not cover all inputs, thus the inputs not tested are not covered by the empirical analysis.
- An algorithm must be fully implemented in order to test it, but we only want to implement the fastest algorithm.
