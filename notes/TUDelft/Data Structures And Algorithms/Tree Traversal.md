## Tree Traversal
[[Tree]] Traversal is the process of visiting/processing every node in a tree using a consistent method. Every traversal algorithm, has a time complexity in [[Big-Oh Notation]] $O(n)$ where n is the number of nodes in the tree. There are two types of three traversal methods:

* **Depth First:** In this method, we go down each subtree of a node before visiting other nodes, so the nodes at lower heights aren't necessarily prioritized. There are two algorithms for this:
	* [[Pre-Order Traversal]]
	* [[Post-Order Traversal]]
* [[Breadth-First Traversal]].
