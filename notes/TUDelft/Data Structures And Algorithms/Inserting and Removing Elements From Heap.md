## Inserting and Removing and Elements to/from Heap

### Adding Elements
When adding an element, add the element to the end of the heap, and apply [[Up-Heap Bubbling]] to that element.

### Removing an Element
When removing an element, you fill the empty spot in the heap with the last element in the heap and apply [[Down Heap Bubbling]] on that element.
