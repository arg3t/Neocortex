## Comparables and Comparators
In Java, there are two important interfaces, **comparable** and **comparator**.

### Comparable
A [comparable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) is an interface with a generic. A class implementing it must also implement the `compareTo` function.

### Comparator
[Comparators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) are classes that compare two objects.
