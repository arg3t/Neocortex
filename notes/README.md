# Welcome!

This is an online version of my zettelkasten. I use Obsidian to edit my notes
on my ipad and laptop and use DroneCI's continous integration through gitea to
keep this website up-to-date. Since this is Zettelkasten, it should mostly be
made of small notes and a bunch of "random" and "disconnected" knowledge, ideas
and thoughts. If you find it confusing, don't worry, stay calm and read the book
[How to Take Smart
Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y)
by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.
