# Time sharing

Time sharing is the process of running a program for some time, then stoppping it and switching to another one. This way, every process takes a share out of the CPUs cycles.


# A Process
A process is an abstaction for the OS. It consists of the address space of a running program, the current state of the registers, incuding the RIP/Program Counter.  Depending on the OS, it might also contain a list of open files and corresponding file descriptors.


# Policy vs Mechanism
Policy is the theory of decision making/the algorithm while the mechanism is how that algorithm is implemented on the silicon.
