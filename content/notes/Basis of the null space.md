The basis of the [[/notes/Null Space|Null Space]] of a matrix $A$ is determined using the following method.
 
 1. Create a linear system $Ax = 0$
 2. Convert it into [[/notes/Parametric Vector Form|Parametric Vector Form]]
 3. The column vectors in this parametric vector form are the basis of the null space.
