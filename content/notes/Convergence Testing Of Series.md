There are several methods that can be used in order to test whether a series is convergent.
1. [[notes/Divergence Test|Divergence Test]] The least useful of them all
2. [[notes/Alternating Series Test|Alternating Series Test]] A test to check whether alternating series converge
3. [[notes/Comparison Test|Comparison Test]] A test similar to the squeeze theorem in limits
4. [[notes/Limit Comparison Test|Limit Comparison Test]] Similar to the comparison test, except it involves limits
5. [[notes/Ratio Test|Ratio Test]] A test which eventually leads us to power series
