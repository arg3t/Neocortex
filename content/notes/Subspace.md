A subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subset $W \in \mathbb{R}^n$. For a subset to be considered a *subspace*, it must conform to the following conditions:

1. The zero [[notes/Vectors|vector]] must be in $W$
2. If $v$ and $u$ is in $W$, $u + v$ must also be in $W$, as well as the [[notes/Vector Span|Vector Span]] of those two vectors
