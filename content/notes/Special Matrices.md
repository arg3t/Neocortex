## Zero matrix
A matrix with zeros instead of all its values:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Square matrix
A matrix with a square shape, $n \times n$. Subtypes of the square matrix exist, especially defined by their diagonals:

### Diagonal Matrix
Only the entries on the diagonals are not zeros

### Identity matrix

^81da11

Just like a diagonal matrix, but all diagonals are 1

### Lower/Upper triangular matrix

^563d5a

One side of the diagonal must be all zeros
