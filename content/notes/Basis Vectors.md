The basis vectors of a [[notes/Subspace|Subspace]] $W$ is a set of vectors that are:

1. [[notes/Linear Indepence and Dependence|Linearly independent]]
2. [[notes/Vector Span|Span]] $W$

> A subspace can have more than one basis

> Different bases for the same subspace has the same number of vectors
