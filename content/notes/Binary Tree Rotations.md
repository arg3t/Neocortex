A rotation of a [[notes/Binary Tree|Binary Tree]] node is basically replacing a node with one of its children. In order to sustain the search tree property of a binary tree however, when replacing a node with its left child, the host becomes its right child, and the reverse applies when replacing wit its right child. One or more rotate operations can be applied consecutively to esentially restructure a tree.
