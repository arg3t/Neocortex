(2,4) trees are basically [[notes/Multiway Search Trees|Multiway Search Trees]] with two added rules:

- Every internal node can have at most 4 children
- Every external node has the same depth

In order to sustain this property, some checks and resutructuring often needs to be made in order to sustain this (2,4) tree property.
