Graphs are data-structures made up of nodes/vertices and edges. In a graph, vertices are connected to each other using edges. So, graphs can be represented using two sets, a set of edges and a set of vertices. If the graph is undirected, each edge should be a set as well. If it is directed however, edges must be represented as tuples.
