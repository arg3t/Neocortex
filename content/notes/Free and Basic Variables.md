A variable in a linear system can either be **basic**, or **free**.

A variable is basic if when reduced to [[/notes/Echeleon Forms|echeleon form]], it acts as a pivot. Otherwise, it is a free variable. If there are any free variables in a linear systems, it has got [[/notes/Solutions of Linear Systems|infinite solutions]].
