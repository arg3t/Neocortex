When drawing [[notes/ER Diagrams|ER Diagrams]], you need to draw relationships between [[notes/Entity|Entity]]s, for which you use lines. However, there are cases where a single line is not enough, cases where you need to **enforce** that line. Which means that every single entity must have that relationship. This is called **total participation**.
