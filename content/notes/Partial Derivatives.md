When dealing with [[/notes/Multivariable Functions|Multivariable Functions]], it is hard to talk about regular derivations. Instead, we calculate the partial derivatives of the function according to a certain variable. Which is written as:
$$f_x(x,y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$

When calculating the partial derivative for a certain variable, the other variables are treated as constants.

> Partial derivation is VERY different from implicit differentiation since here, y is an independent variable and not a function that is defined according to x. 
> For second-order derivatives and higher, the order of derivation doesn't matter due to [[/notes/Clairaut's Theorem|Clairaut's Theorem]]
