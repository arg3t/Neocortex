[[notes/Eigenvalues|Eigenvalues]] have several properties:

- [[notes/Eigenvectors|Eigenvectors]] that correspond to different eigenvalues are linearly independent
	- This means that $n \times n$ [[notes/Matrixes|matrix]] can have at most $n$ different eigenvalues.
	
- The eigenvalues for a [[notes/Special Matrices#^563d5a|triangular matrice]] are the entries in its diagonal**.
