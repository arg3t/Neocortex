The determinant of a [[/notes/Matrixes|matrix]] is how much that [[/notes/Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] changes the space that a **unit square** takes. Since a unit square can be infinitely small, a determinant therefore gives us by what factor $c$ any given matrix multiplies any shape's area.

## Zero Determinants
If the determinant is zero, it means that the shape is squeezed into a smaller [[/notes/Dimension|Dimension]] by the matrice.

## Negative Determinants
A negative determinant means that the shape is **flipped over**.
