A crtitical point in [[/notes/Multivariable Functions|Multivariable Functions]] are stationary points in the graph. *i.e.* $f_x(a,b) = f_y(a,b) = 0$. Or if the derivative of a function does not exist at that point.

A critical point can either be a [[/notes/MinMax Points in Multivariable Functions|Minima/Maxima]] or a saddle point.
