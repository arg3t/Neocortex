Priority queues are data types similar to regular [[/notes/Queue|Queue]]s, except that they are not a *FIFO* data structure. Instead, each element in a priority queue has a **key** and a **value**. The elements are outputted using the **key** in the order that the element with the lowest key is outputted first. Even though keys are often thought to be integers, they can be any type of data thanks to the [[/notes/Comparables and Comparators|Comparables and Comparators]] in java.
