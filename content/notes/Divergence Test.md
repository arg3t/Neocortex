The divergence test is pretty much the least useless one. All it does is that it checks if a [[notes/Series|Series]] is not [[notes/Convergent Series|convergent]]. The idea is that a series

$$
S = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n
$$

converges if $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$. However, since this is not an if and only if statement, all it says that is if $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \neq 0$, then the series is divergent.
