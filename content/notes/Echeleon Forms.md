Echeleon forms are special matrices such that they are in the form:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & P & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & P & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & P \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In this matrice, $P$'s are called pivot points, meaning that they can be any value besides 0. While $*$'s can be any value.
