The nearest mean classifier follows very closely from the ideas in [[Two Class Quadratic Classifier|Two Class Quadratic Classifier]]. Except, it does not make use of a covariance matrix. Instead, it classifies a given point based on its distance to the mean of each of the classes.

This too, is a linear classifier.
