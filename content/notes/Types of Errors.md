In classification, an error is often represented by the symbol $\epsilon$. A misclassification can be one of two types: 
- **False Positive (Type I)**: A false positive is misclassfying a given data point to belong to a class while it actually is not.
- **False Negative(Type II)**: A false negative is misclassfying a data point to not belong to a class while in fact it does.
