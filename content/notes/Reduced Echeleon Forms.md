Reduced echeleon forms are a specialized form of [[/notes/Echeleon Forms|Echeleon Forms]] which is:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & * & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & * & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The main difference between reduced and regular echeleon forms is that $P$s are $1$ and the column that the pivots are in, all the other rows must have the value $0$.
