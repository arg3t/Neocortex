The [[/notes/Basis Vectors|Basis Vectors]] of a [[/notes/Column Space|Column Space]] are determined using the following method:

1. The [[/notes/Matrixes|matrix]] is row reduced so that it is in [[/notes/Echeleon Forms|echeleon form]]
2. The columns in the **original matrix** that have a pivot point in the reduced matrix act as the basis vectors of the column space
