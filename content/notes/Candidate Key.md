A candidate key is a set of attributes or multiple attributes, which can be used to identify a tuple in a database. The way you can find the candidate keys in a schema is using the definition:
> A [[notes/Super Key|Super Keys]] is also a candidate key if no subset of that superkey is a superkey in its own.
