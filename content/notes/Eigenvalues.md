The eigenvalue of an [[notes/Eigenvectors|eigenvector]] $w$ is basically how much the [[notes/Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] scales the [[notes/Vectors|vector]]. An eigenvector can only have one eigenvalue, however, there are infinitely many eigenvectors for a given eigenvalue, since all the multiples of the eigenvector $w$ has an eigenvalue of $\lambda$ as well.
