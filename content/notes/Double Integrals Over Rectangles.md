When the $\Delta A$ approaches zero while calculating the [[/notes/3D Riemann Sum on Rectangles|3D Riemann Sum on Rectangles]], it can be written as an integral. An integral for a function that calculates the area under a function $f(x,y)$ over a rectangle $D$ is written as:

$$
\iint_D f(x,y) dA
$$
