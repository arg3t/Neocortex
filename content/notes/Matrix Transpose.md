The transpose of a [[notes/Matrixes|matrix]] is basically the matrix but turned around. The transpose of a matrix $n \times m$ is equal to a matrix of size $m \times n$, in which, rows become columns. A transpose is represented by $A^T$.

> An important property of transpose regarding [[notes/Matrix Multiplication|Matrix Multiplication]], is that $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$
