The [[notes/Eigenvalues|Eigenvalues]] of a given [[notes/Matrixes|matrix]] don't always have to be real, they can also be [[notes/Complex Numbers|Complex Numbers]]. If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, than $\overline{\lambda}$ is also an eigenvalue with $\overline{v}$ as its [[notes/Eigenvectors|eigenvector]].
