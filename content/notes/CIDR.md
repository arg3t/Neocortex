CIDR ranges are the implementation of [[notes/IP Ranges|ip ranges]] in the modern internet. CIDR ranges are distributed to organizations via a central authority. Servers that keep track of CIDR ranges also aggregate different ranges into one and direct that range to another central server in the default free zone. 

> The default free zone servers are essentially servers with full BGP tables and has access to different ASs(Autonomus Systems)
