create a file that contains all the letters in the alphabet, and run the encrypt binary on the file. Now you have a one-to-one map of all the letters and their correspondants. Using this info you can easily decode the string:

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    MNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKL

    OMQEMDUEQMEK
    caeseriseasy (CAESARISEASY)
