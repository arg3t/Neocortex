This test is similar to [[/notes/The Squeeze Theorem - Limits|the squeeze theorem]]. Given two series, $\sum a_n$ $\sum b_n$ with positive terms, if  $\sum b_n$ is convergent and $a_n \leq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\sum a_n$ converges. 

Similarly, if $\sum b_n$ diverges and $a_n \geq b_n$, then $\sum a_n$ must also diverge.
