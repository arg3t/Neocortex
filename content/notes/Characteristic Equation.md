A scalar $\lambda$ is a [[/notes/Matrixes|matrix]] $A$'s [[/notes/Eigenvalues|eigenvalue]] iff the [[/notes/Determinant|Determinant]] of $A - \lambda I$ is $0$.

> The equation $det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ is called the characteristic equation

> The polynomial $det(A - \lambda I)$ is called the characteristic polynomial
