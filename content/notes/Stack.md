A stack is a data structure that is organized like a *stack* of plates organized one top of each other. You only have access to the plate on top, you can `peek` at it, `pop` it off the stack or `push` a new plate on the stack. The stack you put on the stack last is the plate you take out first. A stack has three basic operations:

* `peek`: Get the first item on top of the stack without removing it. $O(1)$
* `pop`: Get the first item on top of the stack and remove it. $O(1)$
* `push`: Put a new item on top of the stack. $O(1)$
