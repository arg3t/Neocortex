 The [[notes/Subspace|Subspace]] of [[notes/Eigenvectors|Eigenvectors]] that have the [[notes/Eigenvalues|eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ is called the eigenspace of that eigenvalue and is represented by $E_\lambda$. The eigenspace is found by calculating the [[notes/Null Space|Null Space]] of $A - \lambda I$. Or more mathematically:
 
$$
E_{\lambda}= Nul(A - \lambda I)
$$
