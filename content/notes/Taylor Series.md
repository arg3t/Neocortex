Taylor series are [[/notes/Power Series|Power Series]] which can describe a function $f$, which is continously differentiable. The taylor series of a function $f$ at the point $a$ is defined as:

$$
\sum \frac{f^{(n)}(x-a)^n}{n!}
$$

This power series is equals to $f$ in an open interval which $a$ is in.
