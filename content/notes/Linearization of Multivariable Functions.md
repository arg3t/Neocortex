In single variable functions, it was possible to draw a tangent line that touches the function at a certain point $a$. Similarly, in [[/notes/Multivariable Functions|Multivariable Functions]], it is possible to draw a *tangent plane* to the surface of the function, which linearizes that function at the point $(a,b)$ and at points close to it. The linearized plane's function at $(a,b)$ is calculated by:

$$
L(x) = f(a,b) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x-a) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(y-b)
$$
