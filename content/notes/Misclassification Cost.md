In order to optimize the [[notes/Classification|classification]] model to avoid certain kinds of [[notes/Classification Error|error]]. Misclassification costs can be set during its training. The misclassification cost of classifying a class that belongs to $\omega_j$ as $\omega_i$ is represented by $\lambda_{ji}$.

TL;DR : $\lambda_{ji}$ : *Real class:* $j$, *Guessed class:* $i$.
