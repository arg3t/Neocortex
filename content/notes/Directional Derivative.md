The directional derivative of a [[/notes/Multivariable Functions|multivariable function]] is the rate of change of a function $f(x,y)$ at the direction of a **unit vector** $u$. In order to calculate its directional derivative, we also need its [[/notes/Multivalued Function Gradient|gradient]]. After knowing it, we can simply calculate the dot product of the two [[/notes/Vectors|Vectors]] and that gives us that function's directional derivative at $(x,y)$ with direction $u$:

$$D_u(x,y) = \triangledown f(x,y) \cdot u$$
