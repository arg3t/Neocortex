Whether a system of linear equations has a [[/notes/Solutions of Linear Systems|solution]] is decided by whether the system is consistent or not.

If a system is inconsistent, iff there exists a row such that:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & c
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Otherwise, the matrix is consistent.

> A good rule of thumb to keep in mind is that if a matrice can be written in [[/notes/Echeleon Forms|echeleon form]], it is consistent.
