Routing is the process of finding a path(preferably a short one) between two routers in a netwok. There are several algorithms for routing packets effectively.

- [[notes/Distance Vector Routing|Distance Vector Routing]]
- [[notes/Path Vector Routing|Path Vector Routing]]
- [[notes/Link State Routing|Link State Routing]]

When networks get large, routing becomes an overwhelming problem. Thankfully, [[notes/Hierarchical Routing|hierarchical routing]] and [[notes/CIDR|CIDR ranges]] comes to rescue and makes the problem manageable.
