When training a machine learning model, it is common practice to split your
dataset into two sets. **Training** and **testing** sets. One is used to
estimate the parameters for the model while the other one is used to estimate
the accuracy of the model(I think it is quite obvious which is which).

The main purpose of this practice is to ensure that the model that comes out of
the training is able to **generalize** into unseen data.
