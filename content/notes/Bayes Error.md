Bayes error is the **minimum** [[notes/Classification Error|classification error]] you can have for the true distributions of the data. Regardless of how big your dataset is, you can't get lower than this error. It is obtained by setting the [[notes/Decision Boundaries|decision boundary]]decision boundary at the point where two models' probability distributions intersect.
