Matrix transformations are equations of the form:

$$
T(x) = Ax
$$

Where $A$ is a matrix. The domain of the transformation is the size of the vector that is inputted into the transformation, while the codomain is the size of the vector that transformation outputs:

In the case of a matrice like:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 & 3 \\
2 & 7 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The domain is its length, while the codomain is its height. (Due to the properties of [[/notes/Matrix-Vector Product|Matrix-Vector Product]]). While its range is the [[/notes/Vector Span|Vector Span]] of its column.
