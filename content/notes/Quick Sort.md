Quick sort is an algorithm that splits the array into three parts according to a **pivot** value, `L, E, G`, array with the elements that are less then, equal to, or greater than the pivot respectively. This approach is very depenedent on [[/notes/Quick Sort Pivot Selection|how good the pivot is chosen]] and the complexity of the algorithm is volatile because of that.
