A [[/notes/Homogenous Linear Systems|homogenous linear system]] can have another solution than the [[/notes/Trivial Solution|Trivial Solution]] iff it has a [[/notes/Free and Basic Variables|free variable]]. This is because if there are no free variables, than the system has [[/notes/Solutions of Linear Systems|only one solution]].
